## CocoaAsyncSocket
A rich collection of classes for asynchronous socket networking over TCP and UDP for Mac OS X and iOS

### NOTES
The 'master' branch is a direct mirror of the Google code [master branch](http://code.google.com/p/cocoaasyncsocket/source/browse/) and the hyperbolically name 'hyper-modern' branch contains a handful of small changes needed to build on Lion with Xcode 4.2 and fix some UDP bugs.
